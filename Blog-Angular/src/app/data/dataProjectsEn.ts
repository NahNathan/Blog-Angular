        "description":"This project was done in a group for the ADS course in the fifth semester. Its goal is to be a web platform for courses and projects for IFTM students, where they can register, post, and watch other content created by other students and teachers. I really enjoyed doing this project and learned a lot about several aspects of agile development, as well as technical knowledge. I was primarily responsible for the project's frontend, built in React. Understanding concepts such as API consumption and HTTP requests was integral to the project. An AI was also integrated into the project, summarizing the article and answering questions about it. This AI was an integration with the Gemini API. I was responsible for the front-end, screen design, and integration with back-end data. This project was done with Augusto-Catejon, c-Alvinn, and DevGustavus.",

It also includes integration with AI-generated and optimized educational materials, allowing teachers to create exams, questions, activities, exam corrections, lesson plans, explanatory content, and several other resources. I fully developed the front end using Next.js and integrated it with a Node.js backend, applying best practices of the framework and server-side rendering (SSR).",

        "description":"While studying Analysis and Systems Development at IFTM Uberaba Parque Tecnológico, I participated in the Hackathon IFTM 2024, which was an amazing and enriching experience. The main challenge for two full days was to develop a practical technological solution aimed at the education sector, with the requirement to incorporate Artificial Intelligence into some aspect of the project. Our proposal was SAPI, or the Intelligent Pedagogical Assistance System, an educational platform designed to support teachers by assisting in the creation of various classroom components such as lesson plans, exams, questions, activities, and more. Although our proposal did not achieve the success we had hoped for, after the hackathon, we participated in the Fator S Agita event, sponsored by Sebrae. There, we learned in detail how to conceptualize and plan a project like the one we developed. Without a doubt, this experience was incredibly informative and innovative, and the knowledge I gained was invaluable.",
